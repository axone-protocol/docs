# Installation

You'll find below the available ways of getting the needed `okp4d` binary to start a node.

## Supported platforms

`okp4d` currently supports the following builds.

| **Platform** | **Arch** |       **Status**      |
|--------------|----------|:---------------------:|
| Darwin       | amd64    |           ‚úÖ          |
| Darwin       | arm64    |           ‚úÖ          |
| Linux        | amd64    |           ‚úÖ          |
| Linux        | arm64    |           ‚úÖ          |
| Windows      | amd64    | Ô∏èüö´<br/> Not supported |

## Release binary

You'll find the released binaries on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/okp4/okp4d/releases). These are statically linked builds, so be careful to choose the right binary for your system (i.e. `linux/amd64` or `linux/arm64`). Checksums are also provided if you wish to verify the integrity of the download.

To easily install `okp4d` from a GitHub release you can use this [oneliner script](https://github.com/jpillora/installer):

<CodeBlock language="bash">
curl https://i.jpillora.com/okp4/okp4d@{data.okp4dVersion}! | bash
</CodeBlock>

:::caution

By principle, take the time to verify the checksum manually.

:::

## Docker

The `okp4d` binary can be invoked directly through the following docker image:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
docker run -ti --rm okp4/okp4d:{data.okp4dVersion} --help
</CodeBlock>

:::tip

_Build once, deploy anywhere_: The docker image is a multi-arch build supporting both `amd64` and `arm64` architectures.

## Build from source

### Prerequisites

- `go` ‚Äî OKP4 is built using [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) version 19+. Install `Go` `1.19+` following instructions from the [official Go documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install).
- `make` ‚Äî the project comes with a convenient `Makefile` so verify that [`make`](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make) is properly installed.
- `git` ‚Äî in order to clone the project you need to have [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

### Steps

Clone the [okp4/okp4d](https://github.com/okp4/okp4d) repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/okp4/okp4d.git
cd okp4d
```

Install `okp4d` using the provided `Makefile`:

```bash
make install
```

You can verify that everything is OK:

```bash
okp4d version
```

You should get an output similar to:

<CodeBlock language="text">
{data.okp4dVersion}
</CodeBlock>
