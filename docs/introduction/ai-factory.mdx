<i>Reading time: {readingTime} min</i>

In the previous section, we highlighted the target audience of the protocol using concise examples. To delve deeper into the power of this protocol, this section will examine the underlying motivations for its creation through more detailed and concrete case studies.

## Context

The rapid development of AI models redefines the boundaries of what is possible in many fields. Increasingly, the ability to use existing open-source models or create one's own AI models to meet specific needs is becoming accessible to everyone.

The swift adoption by users of applications such as ChatGPT has catalyzed innovations in fundamental model architectures and other techniques. Today, many small and medium-sized technology companies, individuals, and researchers are working on new ML models or improving existing ones.

However, as is often the case in the Web2 domain, research and knowledge are not shared, evolving in silos and hindering innovation. The trade-off between risks related to trust, security, and costs versus incentives is not aligned. In this context, Axone provides an ideal solution with an open, decentralized, and interoperable infrastructure to simplify the coordination of AI resources and address fundamental misalignment in resource sharing.

Within the Dataverse, providers can share any resources under any conditions by enabling new means of coordinating and collaborating to develop collective intelligence, enhance existing solutions, and unlock new synergies.

Let's delve into the AI landscape and understand why Axone is a cutting-edge solution to support AI development with an open, scalable approach.

## AI Factory: Decentralized Framework for collaboratively trained and governed models

### What is it?

The AI factory is a decentralized framework where anyone can collaborate and govern models, datasets, and applications. It enables the creation of a zone where different identities can coordinate around blockchain-based governance rules enforced on-chain to train a model using the wealth of resources and services from the Dataverse.

AI Factory is a set of :

- Rules & governance templates : data requirements definitions, contribution quantification, token factory for DAO's
- Open-source algorithms ready to be trained and tailored services/workflows
- Integrations and connectors

### What are the benefits?

**Resilient Service-Level Agreements:** Axone offers robust SLAs by ensuring the integrity of computation and storage, upholding adherence to consent rules (including privacy and retribution considerations), demonstrating censorship resistance, and maintaining a transparent data provenance.

**Flexibility in Governance:** Axone empowers users to shape a sustainable ecosystem of services through incentivized alignment and programmable, adaptive on-chain governance. This flexibility allows for dynamic adjustments to better suit evolving needs and ensures the longevity and adaptability of the governance framework.

**Modular and Interoperable Infrastructure:** Within the Dataverse, Axone leverages a diverse array of resources and services, providing users with a comprehensive selection of implementation options. This modular and interoperable approach enables seamless integration and facilitates the development of solutions tailored to diverse requirements and preferences.

**Performance enhancements:** Collaborative training enhances performance and precision by leveraging the specialized skills of diverse contributors. Each participant can bring expertise in specific domains, resulting in an overall improvement in AI performance. Collaborative approaches solve complex problems by combining multidisciplinary knowledge, leading to more accurate and efficient AI models.

**Diversity and reducing biases:** Collaborative AI Training fosters diversity in perspectives and data. By involving multiple stakeholders in the AI training process, diverse perspectives and experiences are brought to the table. This collaborative effort allows the AI to be trained on a broader set of data, reflecting various real-world situations. The diversity in training data contributes to making models more robust and generalized, thereby reducing potential biases associated with limited datasets.

### How does it work?

In practical terms, AI Factory is represented by three key aspects:

- On-chain Rules and Governance Templates
- All Referenced Resources and Services in the Dataverse Accepted within the Zone's Scope
- Integrated Tools and connectors to interconnect with users' existing workflows.

**Rules & Governance Templates**

Defined as a set of rules, these on-chain governance templates establish the boundaries and operational scope of the Zone. They provide a structured framework that outlines the permissible actions and existence parameters within the Zone.

The zone creator can create his own template or reuse an existing one to deploy a framework tailored to quickly specific needs.

<u>Identity Management:</u> This refers to the various authentication methods used to manage access
to the zone. It can range from key-based systems Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) services like Cheqd
to more conventional Single Sign-On (SSO) methods like Sign-in with Google. The choice may depend on
the desired contributor engagement type or the disclosed information's granularity.

<u>Governance Model:</u> Determines how governance is exercised and expressed, ranging from a model
with a single authority to a multi-sig or a DAO around a token model. All governance rules can be
defined, allowing for a highly customizable governance structure.

<u>Resource Management:</u> Define the conditions under which digital resources can be considered
within the scope of an activity involving acting entities. Numerous rules can be expressed regarding
the properties of the digital resources established by their metadata. Rules related to metadata
requirements, format compatibility, size limitations, ownership and intellectual property rights,
and quality assurance may be included.

<u>Business Model:</u> The business model of the zone defines how contributions are quantified and
how contributors are rewarded. This can range from a simple one-time payment for access to more
complex business logic aiming to create an AI Factory with specific services that require a fair and
sustainable compensation system for each contributor.

Once all defined, the zone is registered with a transaction to enforce the rules on-chain.

**Resources and Services allowed and compatible**

Once the governance framework is defined and live on-chain, the protocol can determine the resources that are usable within the newly created AI Factory Zone based on two criteria

![ai-factory-4](/img/content/academy/ai-factory-4.webp)

<u>All Resources and Services allowed by the Zone:</u> The governance rules of the Zone help
determine, within the set of resources referenced in the Dataverse, which ones can be used within
the scope of this zone. All Dataverse resources adhering to these rules are allowed by the Zone.

<u>All Resources and Services compatible with the Zone:</u> Resource Consent defines the conditions
for including a resource in an activity involving entities operating within a Zone. While the Zone
rules specify the regulations from the perspective of the Zone, the consent represents the rules
from the perspective of the Resource. It serves as the expression of the resource owner's
considerations regarding the terms of use for the Resource, providing guidelines for its proper use
within the Dataverse. Rules may include aspects such as the business model, Zone licenses or labels,
and regulations about any credentials, such as identity, reputation, qualification, or token-related
credentials.

All Dataverse resources adhering to these rules are compatible with the Zone.

:::caution

Understanding the unique relationship between the consent of resources and the zone rules is essential. The licenses and zone rules must be compatible, as the powers of a zone recognizing a resource as being included and thus compatible with its operation require reciprocal confirmation of compliance from the helpful resource.

**Essential Types of Resources and Services:**

- <u>Training Dataset:</u> Encompasses various forms of data and information expressed, carried, and
  stored in different formats (structured or unstructured data, data streams, etc.).
- <u>AI Model:</u> Ranges from foundational models to specialized models, from LLM to SLM, with the
  choice typically depending on the type of task for which the model is to be trained. Any kind of
  model may be provided.
- <u>Storage Infrastructure Provider:</u> Supports all storage options, ranging from local storage
  to cloud storage solutions provided by significant companies like Dropbox or AnyDrive.
  Additionally, decentralized storage networks such as Interplanetary File System (IPFS), Jackal, or
  Arweave can be connected to the Dataverse.
- <u>Compute Infrastructure Provider:</u> The Dataverse is adaptable to various computation options,
  including APIs with their own computational resources, cloud services by commercial entities, or
  decentralized computing resources. This flexibility accommodates different types of computational
  tasks and workloads. Relevant general-purpose compute networks like Akash can be easily referenced
  in the protocol. Depending on the type of model to be trained, different kinds of components may
  be necessary, such as CPU, Gaming GPU, or AI-specialized GPU.
- <u>Orchestration Service:</u> This crucial service orchestrates the invocations of other services.
  Notably, a decentralized mechanism is in place to ensure the correct instance of the appropriate
  type is executed, given the potential for multiple instances of the service and several kinds of
  orchestration services.

**Integration and Connectors:**

- <u>APIs and Connectors:</u> APIs provide a standardized interface for accessing and communicating
  with a service, while connectors are components that facilitate the connection between two
  distinct systems by overcoming potential differences in their protocols and communication methods.
  They are crucial for ensuring the connection between different services and the orchestrator.
- <u>Front-end Interface:</u> It serves as the user-friendly entry point for interacting with the
  Zone. A front-end interface acts as a crucial bridge, enabling effective communication and
  interaction between users and the decentralized framework.

As the Dataverse continues to expand, numerous interfaces and APIs will become available, created by the community or external contributors to facilitate accessibility and entry points.

### Unlock New Synergies with AI Factory

It is crucial to emphasize that Axone does not aim to reconstruct each infrastructure component necessary for developing and enhancing the AI Factory individually.

Axone's mission is to provide a decentralized orchestration layer for off-chain resources. This means that Axone seeks not to rebuild each infrastructure component one by one for the development and improvement of the AI Factory.

The goal is to create the most modular and expressive orchestration framework to enable interconnection between cutting-edge services.

Let's consider projects like Akash, which provides an open marketplace for general-purpose computation, or Jackal, offering various decentralized storage solutions. We believe that their solutions are highly relevant in their respective domains. Our role is to facilitate communication and orchestration between these technologies and provide them with a more expansive governance framework.
