# The Hierarchy of Norms

The hierarchy of norms refers to the hierarchical structure of rules within the given governance framework. It establishes the order of precedence among the different norms so that a higher norm prevails over a lower standard.

In the Axone Governance framework, the hierarchy of norms establishes a clear order of precedence for rules and regulations. We thus end up with different levels of governance that allow fine-grained control of the use of the protocol.

The different levels of governance are:

## Protocol Governance

At the top of the hierarchy is Protocol Governance, which establishes the overarching rules and principles for the entire Axone protocol.

## Zone Rules

Under the Protocol Governance, specific Rules are defined for each zone within the protocol.

## Resource Consent

Resource Consent empowers individuals to specify how their resources can be utilized within specific zones or boundaries. The zone rules set the limits and regulations for the use of resources, and Consent operates within those boundaries. Therefore, even if individuals have control over their resources, they must always comply with the existing rules that govern the zones in which the digital resources are involved. Consequently, if the consents associated with a resource are incompatible or contravene a specific zone's rules, the resource will not be considered eligible for that zone.

## Agreement

Within the boundaries of the zone Rules and in alignment with Resource consents, acting parties have the autonomy and flexibility to enter into agreements regarding the orchestration of their digital resources. The agreement serves as a voluntary contract between parties, outlining the specific terms, rights, and obligations regarding the use of resources within the agreed-upon boundaries.
