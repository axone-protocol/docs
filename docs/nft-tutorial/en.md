# OKP4 NFT tutorial

> [Version fran√ßaise](./fr.md)

## Prerequisites

To thank you for investing in the KNOW token of the OKP4 protocol, the team has decided to offer you a unique [NFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token)!

This NFT is part of a collection of 76 NFTs that represent the first SAFT edition. It is a proof of involvement in the project at its beginning. It has no legal value. It can be exchanged, and you are free to do what you want with it. It may or may not entitle you to future benefits.

This NFT is held in a personal [Stargaze](https://www.stargaze.zone/) address we created specifically for you. This address is controlled by a private key that takes the form of a [mnemonic](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase).

However, it is important to transfer it to another address! There is no guarantee that we will get rid of the private key after sharing it with you. So you need to transfer the NFT to a wallet that you created yourself.

This tutorial will help you find your NFT and transfer it to your personal wallet.

## Get Keplr

Keplr is a wallet, a small application that allows you to create, protect and control private keys for addresses on the blockchains of the Cosmos ecosystem.

Keplr allows you to store your key locally on your computer or to use a physical wallet like Ledger or Trezor.

If it's not already done you should get Keplr: <https://www.keplr.app/>
You can use either of the following solutions:

- [Keplr Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap) for [Google chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html) or [Brave](https://brave.com/) browsers.
- [Keplr wallet for Iphone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/keplr-wallet)
- [Keplr wallet for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chainapsis.keplr)
