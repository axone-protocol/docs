# About Axone

Axone is a public [dPoS](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/DPoS) layer 1 specifically designed for connecting, sharing, and monetizing any resources in the AI stack.
It is an open network dedicated to collaborative AI workflow management that is universally compatible with any data, model, or infrastructure.
Data, algorithms, storage, compute, APIsâ€¦ Anything on-chain and off-chain can be shared.

## The protocol

Axone is built on the [Cosmos SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk) & [CometBFT](https://cometbft.com) consensus, and allows companies & individuals to define on-chain rules, share any off-chain resources & create a new generation of applications on top of them. With Axone, share anything digital, on your own terms.

- solves the trust issue related to digital resource sharing <br/>
- sovereign, scalable, multichain & fully customizable (built on Cosmos, leveraging IBC, ICQ & ICA) <br/>
- unlocking real-world value creation, bridging the gap between web2 & web3.<br/>

After 4+ years of strategy, research and development, Axone is almost ready to become the foundation for a scalable Open Dataverse, unlocking a new wave of use cases through real-world decentralized coordination. Our team & community is building a set of tools at the infrastructure, protocol, data and application layers with UX, interoperability, privacy and security in mind, ready to ignite innovation through data sharing.
