# Describe a resource

<i>Reading time: {readingTime} min</i>

Now that you know what a DID and a Verifiable Credential are, and what they mean for the Axone protocol, let's put them into practice! 

You're a digital resource provider and you want to share a dataset or a service. First, you need to describe your resource and register it in the Dataverse (i.e. in the Axone protocol). 

Here are the 4 steps involved:

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <img src="/img/content/academy/describe-resource-1.webp" alt="Steps to describe a resource in the Dataverse" style={{ maxHeight: "340px" }}></img>
</div>

We'll take 2 examples in this tutorial: 

- The dataset [Crime Data from 2020 to Present](https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8/about_data)
- The storage service [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech)

:::info
Prerequisite: 
- [Install the Axone CLI](https://docs.okp4.network/tutorials/cli-1#installing-the-okp4-cli) to interact with the protocol
- Ensure you have `npm` installed on your system. You can follow the installation guide [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).
- Install the [json-cli](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/jsonld-cli) with the following command:
```bash
npm install -g jsonld-cli
```
:::

## Step 1: Create keys

As we saw previously, all entities are identified by a DID in the Dataverse. The first step consists of creating keys and related DID for the issuer of the credentials and the resource itself. 

The Axone Protocol can provide you keys (also called a wallet) and DID. A key pair is created to obtain a wallet to establish secure ownership and control over your assets on the Axone blockchain. The key pair consists of two cryptographic keys: public and private keys.
When creating a wallet, you're typically provided with a mnemonic consisting of 12, 24, or sometimes more words. This mnemonic acts as a human-readable representation of the underlying cryptographic information. It is easier to remember and write down than the complex numbers and characters representing the private key.
The mnemonic serves as a backup mechanism for the wallet. You can regenerate the key pair by inputting the mnemonic into any compatible wallet software to recover access to your funds.

Here, we don't create a wallet for cryptocurrency storage but for secure storage of identifiers: A wallet can securely store digital identifiers, such as proofs of identity, certificates, or other personal identification information. 

:::danger
A keyring is a secure software utility designed to store and manage credentials, such as passwords, cryptographic keys, and API tokens, in a centralized and encrypted form. The `--keyring-backend test` command parameter is intended for use in *testing* environments. However, it is not recommended for production applications where the security of private keys is a highest priority.

For secure keyring setup in production environments, refer to the [Cosmos SDK doc](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/user/run-node/keyring). This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to establishing a secure keyring configuration suitable for production use. 

Avoid using the `--keyring-backend test` option in production, as it leaves private keys unencrypted on the file system, posing a potential security risk.
:::

```bash
​​# Create a new key. Replace "crime-data-lapd" with another name
okp4d keys add crime-data-lapd --keyring-backend test
```

:::danger
If you create a new key pair, the terminal displays a list of 24 words. Store this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
:::

Get the list of all your keys stored locally especially the new one. You can see that the DID related to this key is `did:key:zQ3shRfADCmegmmKotqCjzDc9BHWDpbEzp9yMiN5RkJx88oP5`.

```bash
okp4d keys list --keyring-backend test

address: okp413e4exyqr5chxz5qlg2wpqr5ehmq90q2dgy753z
  did: did:key:zQ3shRfADCmegmmKotqCjzDc9BHWDpbEzp9yMiN5RkJx88oP5
  name: crime-data-lapd
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"Aj8dI0OJWxTGM4gYd89cB8Qzi95DNxR/3F9DAPaNU0Mg"}'
  type: local
```

You can also use the command `okp4d show` to directly find information about a particular wallet. 

```bash
# Replace "crime-data-lapd" with your wallet name
okp4d keys show crime-data-lapd --keyring-backend test
- address: okp413e4exyqr5chxz5qlg2wpqr5ehmq90q2dgy753z
  name: crime-data-lapd
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"Aj8dI0OJWxTGM4gYd89cB8Qzi95DNxR/3F9DAPaNU0Mg"}'
  type: local
```
Reiterate the command to create a wallet to store the IPFS and Issuer's identities. 

So now we have the following information: 

|  | Crime dataset | 
|--------------|------|
| Name of the wallet | crime-data-lapd |
| Public key  | okp413e4exyqr5chxz5qlg2wpqr5ehmq90q2dgy753z | 
| DID  | did:key:zQ3shRfADCmegmmKotqCjzDc9BHWDpbEzp9yMiN5RkJx88oP5 |

|  | IPFS Storage | 
|--------------|------|
| Name of the wallet | digital-resource-ipfs |
| Public key | okp41mlq7l9snuy9m0cznyrv3emn9wsndzle5v4j5q4 |
| DID  | did:key:zQ3shhb4SvzBRLbBonsvKb3WX6WoDeKWHpsXXXMhAJETqXAfB | 

|  | Issuer |
|--------------|------|
| Name of the wallet | issuer-okp4|
| Public key  | okp41ysl9yllv40kfygcdfqj7c9n2a5c5zpmgku8ufg |
| DID  | did:key:zQ3shs7auhJSmVJpiUbQWco6bxxEhSqWnVEPvaBHBRvBKw6Q3 |

:::note
In the future, you will be able to use any key provider, such as Cheqd.  
:::

## Step 2: Create the credentials

Find the credential templates you need in the [Ontology documentation](https://docs.okp4.network/ontology/schemas) according to the nature of the resource you describe. 

For the dataset, instantiate the template [credential-dataset-description](https://github.com/okp4/ontology/blob/main/src/example/dataset/crime-dataset-description.jsonld).  
For the service, instantiate the template [credential-digital-service-description](https://github.com/okp4/ontology/blob/main/src/example/digital-service/ipfs-digital-service-description.jsonld).

:::info
Would you like to describe your dataset with other properties? You can create your template of credentials. Don't directly add these properties in the DatasetDescriptionCredential as defined in the Ontology.

## Step 3: Sign the credentials

Now that you have created the VCs, you will sign them. 

Signing a verifiable credential involves creating a digital signature using cryptographic techniques. This signature is unique to both the document (in this case, the credential) and the signer's private key, making it impossible to forge. The private key is kept secret by the signer, while the corresponding public key is made available for anyone wishing to verify the signature's authenticity.

By signing the credential, any alteration to the credential's data after it has been signed will invalidate the signature. This ensures the data has not been tampered with and remains as it was when issued.

To sign your VC, use this command: 

```bash
okp4d credential sign $/MY-DIRECTORY/MY-DATASET.jsonld 
    --keyring-backend test 
    --from $MY_ADDR | jsonld toRdf -q - > $MY-DATASET.nq
```

With:

- `/MY-DIRECTORY/MY-DATASET.jsonld` : credential file address  
- `MY_ADDR` : issuer address    
- `MY-DATASET.nq` : name of the file with the signed credential in RDF format

Example: 

```bash
okp4d credential sign ipfs-digital-service-description.jsonld 
    --keyring-backend test 
    --from issuer-okp4 | jsonld toRdf -q - > ipfs-digital-service-description.nq
```

You can see that there is new fields in the jsonld with the cryptographic proof.

The VC is now in the hands of the Holder. Note that it is possible that the Issuer is also the Holder. 

The Axone blockchain can only register VCs in N-Quads format. 

## Step 4: Register the credentials in the blockchain

The final step is to register the VCs in the Axone blockchain by submitting them to the Dataverse smart contract. It's the role of the Registrant (who can be the Holder or another entity). 

:::info
Note that as you interact with the Axone blockchain, you must pay fees in $AXON at each transaction.
::: 

```bash
okp4d tx wasm execute $CONTRACT_ADDR \ 
    --node "https://api.drunemeton.okp4.network:443/rpc" \
    --chain-id okp4-drunemeton-1 \ 
    --from $MY_ADDR \ 
    --keyring-backend test
    --gas 10000000 \ "{\"submit_claims\":{\"metadata\": \"$(cat $MY-DATASET.nq | base64)\"}}"
```

With:

- `CONTRACT_ADDR` : dataverse contract address (always the same) - For the Drunemeton testnet use okp418cszlvm6pze0x9sz32qnjq4vtd45xehqs8dq7cwy8yhq35wfnn3qvya8du
- `node "https://api.drunemeton.okp4.network:443/rpc"` : name of the node for the Drunemeton testnet
- `MY_ADDR` : registrant okp4 address  
- `$MY-DATASET.nq` : name of the file with the signed credential in RDF format 

Example: 
```bash
okp4d tx wasm execute okp418cszlvm6pze0x9sz32qnjq4vtd45xehqs8dq7cwy8yhq35wfnn3qvya8du \
    --node "https://api.drunemeton.okp4.network:443/rpc" \
    --chain-id okp4-drunemeton-1 \
    --from issuer-okp4 \
    --keyring-backend test 
    --gas 10000000 "{\"submit_claims\":{\"metadata\": \"$(cat ipfs-digital-service-description.nq | base64)\"}}"
    ```

The Protocol will check the signature and if the public key corresponds to the proof in the VC, the VC is registered in the smart contract (Cognitarium). 

The command returns the hash of the transaction. You can find more details of this transaction in the [Explorer](https://explore.okp4.network/). Select the network (Currently Drunemeton-Testnet), click on the Search icon, and paste the transaction hash.  

Example:
Hash: 766627052AA0A56F56702038E54EC69491386D35E0D76A47F9D5B2321DD56C3E
