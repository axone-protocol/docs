# Frequently Asked Questions

_Work in progress_

## Can you sum up OKP4 in a few sentences?

OKP4 is an ever-expanding Dataverse powering the next generation of Applications. Anyone can define and join Data Spaces where custom rules are shared between participants to transform their Datasets & Services into valuable Applications. Without any trusted third party, without having your data accessed by other participants or Application users.

## Why would someone want to build an application on OKP4 when there are many other blockchains available?

OKP4 is specifically designed for scalable trust minimized data sharing. 

Unlike other general-purpose layer-1s and layer-2s (Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Avalanche, Polygon, Arbitrum...), it is the perfect environment for developers to build Data Spaces & Applications based on digital resources of any kind shared by participants.

OKP4 benefits from the simplicity & freedom of development through SDKs, Data Space governance templates and the ability to provide anything as a service in the dataverse. Soon, the many data & services referenced in the protocol will bring an unstoppable network effect.

## How does OKP4 stores the data?

OKP4 doesn't store the data. It only references the data where it is (wherever it is) and make it available to the network according to the permissions granted by the data provider.
The data can be stored anywhere, with any kind of storage solution, either centralized or decentralized.

## Who is on the team and who are the founders of OKP4?

OKP4 was founded by Emmanuel Aldeguer in 2018, when he was a Data-Driven Marketer. He was later joined by the 3 main executives of the company: Marine Dechamp-Guillaume (Chief Project Manager), Théo Pelliet (Head of Ecosystem) and Christophe Camel (Chief Technology Officer).
OKP4 core team is comprised of 27 people, with diversified and experienced profiles in web3/blockchain, IT development, data science, project management and business development.

## What is the market for OKP4? What is OKP4's ambition in this market?

Data intermediaries will be key players in the trillion dollar data economy of tomorrow.
Decentralized data intermediaries will dominate centralized alternatives.

PwC estimates that global GDP will increase by up to 14% (the equivalent of US$15.7 trillion) by 2030 due to the accelerating development and take-up of data-powered AI.
More specifically, we develop an alternative (and complementary) model to data marketplaces, which is a 1 billion market in 2022. "We" (more specifically, our community-owned digital commons) aim to claim at least 5% of this market in the next five years and expand many new opportunities enabled by trust-minimized data sharing.

OKP4's goal is to be the leading decentralized data intermediary by enabling a new wave of innovation & use cases through unique coordination features.

## What is trust-minimized data sharing?

It is the ability to let data contribute to valuable knowledge and applications without ever exposing the data itself to other participants. Through a trustless network and privacy-preserving techniques, other parties never access the raw data that has been shared. End-users will access only the output (the indicator, the graph, the application...), not the data itself.
Enabling value creation, value sharing, without the risks associated to exposing data.


## What is the Dataverse?

The Dataverse is an ever-expanding combination of digital resources shared by participants: datasets, algorithms, softwares, storage resources, computation resources, identity solutions... Anything can be considered a service as long as it is accessible via an API.
The Dataverse is the basis on which Data Spaces are built to enable Dataverse resources to interact with each other.

## What is a Data Space?

A Data Space is a set of rules shared by Data Space participants:

- Rules that regulates interactions between any data, any service (algorithms, software, storage, computation, identity providers...) or tokens shared by participants. The rules include access rights, business models, tech requirements...
- Governance mechanisms to adapt these rules. This can be quite centralized (monosig or multisig) or decentralized (a Data Space can have its own token, or can use existing tokens as a governance token).

In a Data Space, datasets and algorithms are not stored centrally but at source and are therefore only shared (via [semantic interoperability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_interoperability)) when necessary. Data Spaces can be nested and overlapping, so that a Data Provider, for example, can participate in several Data Spaces at once without the need to copy or move his data.


## How exactly does OKP4 increases trust between Data Space participants?


## How does governance work within OKP4?

## Who will benefit from OKP4?

## How are crypto users affected or will benefit from OKP4?

## Why choose Cosmos as an underlying technology?

## Who are OKP4 competitors?

Our environment is a hybrid of "blockchain layer-1" & "data sharing solutions".

Within the blockchain environment, we compete with generic layer-1s and layer-2s are "block-space providers". But, our technology is specifically designed for such use cases so we can optimize developer, contributor & user onboarding. Additionaly, we will provide value-generating use cases that are extremely complex to implement on other chains.

Within the data sharing environment, our technology is a genuine digital commons everyone can use (no trusted third party needed) designed for synergies between existing solutions. The world doesn't need another "let's build another closed ecosystem to extract value" platform, the world need a digital commons that is designed to break the silos.

Our ambition is to make it too painful NOT to open web2 silos. "Show me the incentives, I'll show you the outcomes".

## What is a data silo?

A data silo is a repository of data that is controlled by one party and is isolated from the rest. It is typically stored in a standalone system and often is incompatible with other datasets. While "data silos" is a term usually used to only talk about data inside an organization, we use it also to qualify data that does not generate value outside an organization.

## What is the purpose of the $KNOW token?

## Is there a decentralized wallet for the $KNOW token?

You can manage your $KNOW tokens with the [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/) Chrome extension. Keplr is a non-custodial blockchain wallet for webpages that allow users to interact with the OKP4 ecosystem.

## What is the marketing strategy for OKP4?

## What is the go-to-market strategy for OKP4?

Our core product is the OKP4 SDK designed for developers.
A SDK is a Software Development Kit: a set of development tools that facilitate the creation of Data Spaces and Applications.
Our goal is to attract as many builders as possible to enable many opportunities for Data Providers & Users, to maximize value flows into the network.

## How do you manage data privacy? And privacy of my interactions with the blockchain?

## How do you align with GDPR or other privacy-concerned compliance?

## How will you onboard existing communities?

## According to which principles was OKP4 designed?

To become the go-to solution for digital resources coordination, we follow 7 principles to maximize opportunities and minimize risks & costs:

### Opportunity-maximization

Onboard Consumers, contributors and users to create new use cases and share value.

- **Designed for Consumers**: to maximize adoption through valuable data applications. Consumers will innovate and design Data Spaces & communities that will enable this wave of valuable data applications. OKP4 is then designed to facilitate on-boarding of Consumers though SDKs & docs, fast deployment through tools & templates, and community empowerment to create a thriving Ecosystem.

- **Designed for contributors**: to maximize value created by data application by onboarding contributors. Value-sharing models and easy to use tools will incentivize participants in infinite ways, encouraging them to share data, algorithms, storage and computation towards a common goal.

- **Designed for freedom**: to maximize opportunities by aligning interest between Providers, Consumers and users through freedom of innovation and customization.

- **Designed for interoperability**: to maximize synergies at the blockchain level through cross-chain communication, at the Ecosystem level thanks to agnosticism, at the Data Space level through interoperability of standards or governance synergies, and also at the application level enabling applications to leverage multiple Data Spaces (or multiple applications leveraging the same Data Space).

### Risk-minimization

Let anyone build and contribute by minimizing trust and technical issues.

- **Designed for sovereignty**: raw data is never stored on-chain. Some metadata is, but only for features such as discoverability, value sharing & security. In some applications, data can be shared through privacy-preserving algorithms to provide a valuable output without transferring the data to another participant/user. That way, Data Providers can be rewarded without any risk of losing sovereignty over their data.

- **Designed for trustlessness**: every rule, right and governance mechanism can be enforced on-chain by the decentralized network of Validators. Coordination between Providers (data, algorithms, storage, computation), Consumers, users, Curators and Governance Participants is autonomous, fluid and unstoppable.

### Cost-minimization

- **Designed for minimal extraction**: no intermediary, only an open digital infrastructure that doesn't seek value-extraction. Its scalable and dedicated nature makes it unlikely to be congested and/or expensive. This app-specific network is supported by incentivized nodes enabling low fees for anyone.

## What are the key principles and features of OKP4?

OKP4 is generic, customizable, scalable, decentralized, permissionless, secure, it enables complex workflows, synergetic and incentivized.

### Generic

OKP4 is a general-purpose communication infrastructure that enables XaaS - Anything as a Service. The Protocol enables anyone to share any data, any algorithm, any storage, any cloud, any SSI, etc. Anyone can earn from these assets and services and make them valuable for the community.

### Customizable

Besides, WHAT you can share, OKP4 is highly customizable in terms of HOW you can share. Smart contracts that govern Data Spaces can be copied, edited, reinvented in infinite ways. Customization is applied to the rules (business models, access mechanisms, constraints on service providers...) and also the mechanisms to change the rules (who can vote, weight of their vote, fixed or dynamic through a token, etc.).

### Scalable

Its generic infrastructure makes it scalable by design, as workflow orchestration, computation and storage is done off-chain and is theoretically unlimited. Nevertheless, indexation, rule enforcement, governance and value-sharing is done on-chain. With a capacity of 10 000 TPS (Transactions Per Second), limits may be reached when dozens to hundreds of highly used data apps coexist on the OKP4 Ecosystem. That is one of the reasons a roll-up strategy is implemented to enable layer-2 scalability and even more roll-up-specific functionalities (such as on-chain privacy features).

### Decentralized

The OKP4 Network has no trusted parties or single points of failure for any function. Many centralized components can intervene in data workflows but are not mandatory. As said before, the infrastructure is generic and its thriving Ecosystem will be composed of many centralized & decentralized independent components.
OKP4 Blockchain is decentralized thanks to the Tendermint consensus and many Validator nodes that find consensus on the state of the Network. Its governance is also decentralized through a DAO. Eventually, as with every PoS networks and token-based DAOs, its decentralization is dependent on the distribution of the token and the ability of one stakeholder to acquire a "dangerous" stake in the Network. Eventually, it all comes down to the value and liquidity of its token on the market. The more distributed and expensive to acquire the token is, the more it can be and stay decentralized.

### Permissionless

Anyone can become a Validator, Delegator, Governance Participant, Consumer, Curator, Builder or a Provider of data, algorithm, storage, or even computational power. Some Data Spaces may be restricted on the user & provider sides, but the infrastructure will always be open and permissionless, ensuring censorship-resistance at the foundation of the technology stack.

### Secure

OKP4 is designed for security at the blockchain level (due to its decentralized nature and robust consensus mechanism), but also at the data level. The blockchain enforces rules such as access control that are immutable (except if consensus is reached to change these rules of course). That way, vulnerability will never be on the blockchain side, but on the user/provider side (if there's a breach in his own cloud infrastructure for a self-hosted data provider, or if a user gets his private keys stolen for example).

### Complex workflows

A user/consumer can design complex workflows such as thousands of datasets interact with hundreds of services to produce a single product or application. A set of tools is provided to enable anyone to easily build such workflows and innovate on how data can be used and shared with confidence.

### Synergetic

OKP4 is modular in terms of infrastructure, but also in terms of governance. While the blockchain is as decentralized as possible, the Data Spaces and resources that interact through it may have centralized components and governance. This enables web2 and web3 synergies with quick-coordination, human-centric UI while keeping web3 strengths such as data sovereignty, tokenized governance, powerful incentives, trustlessness, auditability... OKP4 is then an open infrastructure that suits needs on a spectrum from decentralized communities to private businesses, with many hybrid models and synergies to build and discover.

### Incentivized

To ensure that high-value applications can rely on the network to keep all of its functionalities listed above, OKP4 incentivizes Validators, Delegators, Providers, Curators, Consumers, Builders to ensure development, maintenance, involvement into the Ecosystem. Incentives are designed to align individual interest with public interest through low inflation, fair value distribution and punishment of detrimental behaviors.
