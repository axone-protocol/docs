# Introduction

## Motivation - Why we need data sharing

Digital innovation has tremendously impacted the way we do business, the way we exchange and consume information. Data has become a resource upon which many businesses have been built. It altered our everyday life in every possible way. The amount of generated data keeps increasing and over the next decade, data collection and analysis will be at the core of every business model.

But value from data remains within a handful of companies and organisations, in data silos, isolated and protected. These companies are incentivized to build gated data lakes as big as possible, to keep their users captive and to restrict access to data and information.

We need to open these gates.

### From Data to Knowledge

Data is an objective and elementary description of reality, an observation, facts intended to be processed and interpreted by humans. From data we create information. It is the signifier attached to the data or to a set of data by association. Information is usually subjective, defined by context. And when we combine information, rules, reasoning, and experience, we create knowledge. And knowledge is THE limiting factor to common good. Thus, in order to develop knowledge, we need data.

Data is a non-rival immaterial asset; it can be easily used and duplicated an infinite number of times without changing the nature or the quality. The production of knowledge from data is therefore theoretically infinite. However today, trusted third parties coordinate and govern the data flux in the world.

### Knowledge is essential to common good

At OKP4, we strongly believe that knowledge is essential to common good and that it should be accessible to everyone with minimum constraint. Data should be shared to multiply aggregations and contextualization’s and create value-added and usable knowledge for organizations and people.

Though they have enhanced our live in many ways, traditional trusted third parties have also created a dependency that limits us. The Web 2.0 value chain is based on providers and consumers that enrich platform aggregators with their data, without really getting much in return. The interests of all parties are not aligned and so it becomes an obstacle to data sharing.

Companies want to use Big Data, they produce data, but they don’t know how to exploit it properly. They lack technical skills, they don’t trust the aggregators and the data they contribute with is not rewarded at its fair value.

All these issues are all, eventually, governance issues. You must agree on the rules, on how they are enforced and on how rules are changed. The key is to reach consensus and build the best tools to enforce it.

Then, comes the lack of incentives to share data that never outweigh the risks and costs associated with data sharing. This results in exclusive private data lakes operated by third parties that are unwilling to share data.

Which means underutilization of data, market failures, repression of innovation and an immeasurable opportunity-cost for them and for society at large.

**But what if we could enable trustless data sharing and unlock this untapped potential?**

## Existing approaches

Since data is everywhere and knowledge is essential to the common good, the issue of sharing data and maximizing knowledge creation is far from being a new topic for individuals and organizations.

Among the existing approaches:

### Data sharing

#### Bilateral agreement

#### Multilateral agreement

#### Data Marketplace

#### Data Space

#### Dataverse

### Knowledge creation

#### Data Visualisation

#### Business Intelligence

#### Complex distributed workflows

### Governance

#### Bilateral Governance

#### Centralized Governance

#### Federated Governance

#### Decentralized Governance

## Introducing – OKP4

Gated data lakes are the norm today because we lacked the economic incentives to fund, the technology to build, and the organizational structures to manage an open Dataverse.

It is changing now, with OKP4.

The previous mentioned reasons ([see Motivation](#motivation---why-we-need-data-sharing)) led us to create the Open Knowledge Protocol (OKP4). Indeed, we believe that the only option is to propose a better alternative to knowledge creation, based on digital commons that are non-extractive and decentralized. Our objective is to allow data sharing and processing services in a secure, transparent, reliable and easy way to generate the maximum amount of new knowledge.

Our OKP4 protocol not only enables the creation of Data Spaces. It also maximizes data sharing, based on Web 3.0 value chain, where providers and consumers get optimal compensation for their contribution, in a trustworthy environment. The OKP4 protocol is a community-run technology using blockchain, smart contracts and the KNOW cryptocurrency which we will discuss in later articles.

The traditional business models based upon data exchange need to evolve. As a society we need to let go of the dominant model of selling data sets and access to data flows at fixed prices. The OKP4 protocol enables data sharing without exchange. In other words, only the data coming from different services (algorithms, tools, visualisation…) is accessible to the users, not the raw data. Added to the customized Data Space’s governance, this brings confidence and also widens the scope of possibilities to innovate with economic models.

### The features of the OKP4 Protocol

We have designed the OKP4 protocol to be open, decentralized and auditable. Our solution is based on 4 products :

#### **OKP4 Blockchain** the layer 1 for data sharing

A public blockchain protocol designed specifically to handle the complexity of trustless data sharing and value sharing

- Decentralization and trust is guaranteed by the Tendermint Consensus & our native token $KNOW
- An open-source network controlled by its stakeholders
- A vibrant Smart Contract Hub powered by CosmWasm
- IBC (Inter-Blockchain Protocol) enables seamless communication with other blockchains

#### **OKP4 Ecosystem**: empower the dataverse

Anyone can plug its own infrastructure into the ecosystem and connect it through the blockchain. OKP4 ecosystem enables XaaS (anything as a service). Agnostic by design!

#### **OKP4 Development Kit**

It allows anyone to create and design Data Space with as much freedom as possible. For developers, data scientists and communities at large :

- Customize Data Space governance with no-code tools & templates
- Build dApps from software to interfaces
- Use or provide components & resources in the OKP4 Ecosystem

#### **OKP4 Dataverse**

User-friendly tools to share, contribute, benefit and earn. (wallet / browser extension, blockchain explorer, dataverse portal, catalog of dApps, governance interfaces, etc.)
